"""
A module for finding instantons between vacua in multiple field dimensions.

The basic strategy is an iterative process:

    1. Make an ansatz for the path along which the field will travel.
    2. Split up the equations of motion into components that are parallel and
       perpendicular to the direction of travel along the path.
    3. The direction of motion parallel to the path reduces to a
       one-dimensional equation of motion, which can be solved using the
       overshoot / undershoot techniques in :mod:`.tunneling1D`. Solve it.
    4. Treating the motion of the field as a classical particle moving in an
       inverted potential, calculate the normal forces that would need to act
       on the particle to keep it on the path. If this forces are (close enough
       to) zero, the ansatz was correctly. Otherwise iteratively deform the path
       in the direction of the normal forces, stopping when the forces go to
       zero.
    5. Loop back to step 3 until no further deformation is necessary.

The classes :class:`Deformation_Spline` and :class:`Deformation_Points` will
perform step 3, while :func:`fullTunneling` will run the entire loop.

class Deformation_Spline:
    """
    Deform a path in the presence of a potential such that the normal forces
    along the path are zero.

    This class fits a spline to the points, and does the actual deformation
    on the spline rather than on the points themselves. This make the path
    somewhat smoother than it would otherwise be (which is generally desirable),
    but it does make it difficult to resolve sharp turns in the path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phi : array_like
        The list of points that constitutes the original path. Should have
        shape ``(n_points, n_dimensions)``.
    dphidr : array_like
        The 'speed' along the path at the initial points. This does not change
        as the path deforms. Should have shape ``(n_points,)``. Gets saved into
        the attribute `v2` as ``v2 = dphidr[:,np.newaxis]**2``.
    dV : callable
        The potential gradient as a function of phi. The output shape should be
        the same as the input shape, which will be ``(..., n_dimensions)``.
    nb : int, optional
        Number of basis splines to use.
    kb : int, optional
        Order of basis splines.
    v2min : float, optional
        The smallest the square of dphidr is allowed to be, relative
        to the characteristic force exterted by F_ext. Note that the
        self-correcting nature of the deformation goes away when dphidr=0.
    fix_start, fix_end : bool, optional
        If True, the force on the first/last point along the path is set to
        zero, so the point will not change in the deformation step.
    save_all_steps : bool, optional
        If True, each step gets saved into ``self.phi_list`` and
        ``self.F_list``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    phi : array_like
        Set during initialization, and then rewritten at each step.
    num_steps : int
        Total number of steps taken.

    Additional (private) attributes

    _X, _dX, _d2X : array_like
        Spline basis functions and their derivatives evaluated at `_t`. Set

            ``checkAfterFit == True``, the normal force in this ratio is defined
            by the change in phi this step *after* being fit to a spline. Note
            that if the spline does a poor job of fitting the points after the
            deformation in this step (which might be the case if there are not
            enough basis functions), and if ``checkAfterFit == False``, this
            ratio can be non-zero or large even if there is no change in `phi`.

        Notes
        -----
        In prior versions of this function (CosmoTransitions v1.0.2 and
        earlier), the start and end points of the
        path were effectively held fixed during the main deformation. This was
        because the line ``phi_lin = phi[:1] + ...`` was calculated *before* the
        line ``phi = phi+F*stepsize``. Since the spline basis functions are
        zero at the start and end points (the spline is added on top of the
        straight line between the end points), when the points were later taken
        from the spline the end points wouldn't move. This was by design, since
        for thin-walled bubbles the endpoints should stay fixed at the two
        vacua. However, this caused problems for thick-walled bubbles where the
        end points should move.

        To get around this, prior versions added an extra block of code to move
        the end points before the main deformation. However, this was
        unnecessarily complicated and led to error-prone code. In this version,
        the end points are always allowed to move if the force `F` is non-zero.
        In the thin-walled case, the force should be almost exactly zero at
        the end points anyways (there is zero potential gradient and `dphidr` is
        zero), so they should stay fixed on their own.

class Deformation_Points:

    Deform a path in the presence of a potential such that the normal forces

    Unlike :class:`Deformation_Spline`, this class changes the points
    themselves rather than fitting a spline to the points. It is a more
    straightforward implementation, and when run with comparable inputs (i.e.,
    the number of basis splines is about the same as the number of points), this
    method tends to be somewhat faster. The individual stepsizes here change
    with the total number of points, whereas in the spline implementation they
    mostly depend on the number of basis functions. However, as long as the path
    is fairly smooth, the total number of splines in that class can probably be
    smaller than the total number of points in this class, so this class will
    tend to be somewhat slower.

    The two implementations should converge upon the same answer when the
    number of points and basis functions get large.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phi : array_like

        as the path deforms. Should have shape ``(n_points,)``. Gets saved into
        the attribute ``self.v2`` as ``v2 = dphidr[:,np.newaxis]**2``.
    dV : callable
        The potential gradient as a function of phi. The output shape should be
        the same as the input shape, which will be ``(..., n_dimensions)``.
    fix_start, fix_end : bool, optional
        If True, the force on the first/last point along the path is set to

    save_all_steps : bool, optional
        If True, each step gets saved into ``self.phi_list`` and
        ``self.F_list``.

class SplinePath:
    """
    Fit a spline to a path in field space, and find the potential on that path.

    The spline-fitting happens in several steps:

      1. The derivatives of the input points are found, and used to
         determine the path length and direction at each point.
      2. If `extend_to_minima` is True, additional points are added at each end
         of the path such that ends lie on local minima.
      3. The points are fit to a spline, with the knots given by the path
         distances from the first point.
      4. If `reeval_distances` is True, the distances to each point are
         re-evaluated using the spline. A new spline is fit with more accurate
         knots.

    The potential as a function of distance can be defined in one of two ways.
    If `V_spline_samples` is None, the potential as a function of distance `x`
    along the path is given by `V[pts(x)]`, where `pts(x)` is the spline
    function that defines the path. If `V_spline_samples` is not None, the
    potential is first evaluated `V_spline_samples` times along the path, and
    another spline is fit to the output. In other words, when `V_spline_samples`
    is None, the input potential `V` is evaluated for every value `x` passed to
    to the class method :meth:`V`, whereas if `V_spline_samples` is not None,
    the input potential is only evaluated during initialization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pts : array_like
        The points that describe the path, with shape ``(num_points, N_dim)``.
    V : callable
        The potential function. Input arrays will be shape ``(npts, N_dim)`` and
        output should have shape ``(npts,)``. Can be None.
    dV : callable, optional.
        The gradient of the potential. Input arrays will be shape
        ``(npts, N_dim)`` and output should have shape ``(npts, N_dim)``. Only
        used if ``V_spline_samples=None``.
    V_spline_samples : int or None, optional
        Number of samples to take along the path to create the spline
        interpolation functions. If None, the potential is evaluated directly
        from `V` given in the input. If not None, `V_spline_samples` should be
        large enough to resolve the smallest features in the potential. For
        example, the potential may have a very narrow potential barrier over
        which multiple samples should be taken.
    extend_to_minima : bool, optional
        If True, the input path is extended at each end until it hits local
        minima.
    reeval_distances : bool, optional
        If True, get more accurate distances to each knot by integrating along
        the spline.

    """
    Calculate the instanton solution in multiple field dimension.

    This function works by looping four steps:

      1. Fit a spline to the path given by phi.
      2. Calculate the one-dimensional tunneling along this path.
      3. Deform the path to satisfy the transverse equations of motion.
      4. Check for convergence, and then go back to step 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_pts : array_like
        An array of points that constitute the initial guess for the tunneling
        path, with shape ``(num_points, N_dim)``. The first point should be at
        (or near) the lower minimum (the minimum to which the field is
        tunneling), and the last point should be at the metastable minimum.
    V, dV : callable
        The potential function and its gradient. Both should accept input of
        shape ``(num_points, N_dim)`` and shape ``(N_dim,)``.
    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum number of allowed deformation / tunneling iterations.
    save_all_steps : bool, optional
        If True, additionally output every single deformation sub-step.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print a message at the start of each step.
    callback : callable
        User supplied function that is evaluted just prior to deforming the
        path. Should return True if the path should be deformed, and False if
        the deformation should be aborted. Should accept 4 arguments: a
        :class:`SplinePath` instance which describes the tunneling path, a
        tunneling object (instance of ``tunneling_class``), the profile found
        by the tunneling object, and extra callback data.
    callback_data : any type
        Extra data to pass to the callback function if there is one. If this
        function is called from :func:`transitionFinder.findAllTransitions`,
        the callback data is the tunneling temperature.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    V_spline_samples : int, optional
        Passed to :class:`SplinePath`. If None, no second derivative will be
        passed to the tunneling class, and it will instead be evaluted using
        finite differences.
    tunneling_class : class, optional
        Either :class:`tunneling1D.SingleFieldInstanton` or a subclass.
    tunneling_init_params : dict, optional
        Extra parameters to pass to the tunneling class.
    tunneling_findProfile_params : dict, optional
        Extra parameters to pass to ``tunneling_class.findProfile()``.
    deformation_class : class, optional
        Either :class:`Deformation_Spline` or :class:`Deformation_Points`, or
        some other object that exposes the same interface.
    deformation_init_params : dict, optional
        Extra parameters to pass to the deformation class.
    deformation_deform_params : dict, optional
        Extra parameters to pass to ``deformation_class.deformPath()``.

    Returns
    -------
    profile1D : namedtuple
        The return value from ``tunneling_class.findProfile()``.
    Phi : array_like or list
        The points that constitute the final deformed path. They are in
        one-to-one correspondence with the points in `profile1D`.
    action : float
        The Euclidean action of the instanton.
    fRatio : float
        A ratio of the largest transverse force on the final path relative to
        the largest potential gradient. This would be zero if the solution were
        perfect.
    saved_steps : list
        A list of lists, with each sub-list containing the saved steps for each
        deformation. Only written to if `save_all_steps` is True.

    Examples
    --------
    The following code shows typical usage for :func:`fullTunneling`. Most of
    the code is in setting up the potentials and plotting; it only takes one
    line to actually calculate each instanton.

    .. plot:: ../examples/fullTunneling.py
       :include-source:

    The callback function can be useful when this function is run from
    :func:`transitionFinder.findAllTransitions`. In that case, one doesn't need
    to accurately calculate the tunneling path when one knows that the action is
    already below some threshold. For example, the following callback function
    will abort the deformation when ``action / T <= 120``::

        def callback(path, tobj, profile, T):
            action = tobj.findAction(profile)
            return action / T > 120
